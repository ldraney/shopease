# ECS vs. EKS: Choosing the Right Container Orchestration for Our Team

## Overview
When considering container orchestration solutions for our team, itâ€™s crucial to weigh the benefits and trade-offs of Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) and Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). Given our small team size, current AWS spending, and goal to focus on product development while scaling efficiently, ECS emerges as a strong candidate. Below are the key considerations and conclusions.

## Key Considerations

### 1. Current AWS Spending
- **Cost Efficiency:** 
  - **ECS:** More cost-effective as it does not incur additional management fees beyond the underlying EC2 instances and resources.
  - **EKS:** Includes a management fee of $0.10 per hour per cluster, in addition to the costs of EC2 instances.
- **AWS Integration:** 
  - **ECS:** Tightly integrated with AWS services, simplifying billing and overall cost management.

### 2. Team's Kubernetes Familiarity - engineering costs. 
Consider that a networking issue, for example, is much easier to diagnose using ecs than EKS; 
Also consider that with tools like AWS support and Datadog, it is much easier to identify AWS issues and outsource problems, or recieve assistance on problems, rather than to be dependent on internal teams. 
-  **Learning Curve:**
  - **ECS:** Lower learning curve, reducing time and resources needed for training and onboarding.
  - **EKS:** Steeper learning curve due to the complexity of Kubernetes.
- **Operational Simplicity:**
  - **ECS:** Easier to set up and maintain, with fewer components to manage.
  - **EKS:** Involves managing multiple Kubernetes components, increasing complexity.
 

### 3. Focus on Product Development
- **Reduced Operational Overhead:**
  - **ECS:** Allows the team to concentrate more on developing and improving our product rather than managing infrastructure.
- **Enterprise Support Benefits:**
  - **ECS:** Leveraging AWS Enterprise Support ensures quick diagnosis and resolution of AWS-specific issues, further reducing operational burden.

### 4. Scalability
- **ECS Scalability:** ECS is designed to scale efficiently with our needs, handling increased workloads seamlessly as our company grows.
- **Future-Proofing:** ECS provides flexibility for future adjustments if our needs evolve to require advanced Kubernetes features.

## Conclusion
Given our context as a smaller team within a successful company on AWS aiming to scale, ECS is a compelling choice for several reasons:
1. **Cost Efficiency:** Lower costs without additional management fees.
2. **Ease of Use:** Simpler setup and maintenance, allowing us to focus on product development.
3. **Operational Efficiency:** Reduced operational overhead with the support of AWS Enterprise Support.
4. **Scalability:** Efficiently handles scaling needs as the company grows.

By choosing ECS, we can maximize our resources, minimize complexity, and ensure that our team remains agile and product-focused while scaling effectively.
